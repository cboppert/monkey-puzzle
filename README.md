# Monkey Puzzle Genetic Algorithm

## The Puzzle
A monkey part is either a monkey bottom or a monkey top and each monkey part comes in one of *k* colors. A monkey tile is a square tile with a monkey part on each edge (North, East, South, West). Finally a monkey board is an *nxn* board filled with monkey tiles.

Can you optimally arrange the tiles so that the most monkey parts are matched to their corresponding monkey parts?

## Constraints
*k* = 5 (Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue)

*n* = 5

Each type of monkey part (Red monkey top, red monkey bottom, etc.) exist in equal measure (10 per).

Translation of tiles is allowed but rotation is not.
